# Detection-Osteoporose
__Study of bone fragility : Application for osteoporosis detection

This project involves classifying images of bone to predict whether the person has osteoporosis or not. 

__Texture analysis of an image

In order to analyse the texture of an image , we use different methods : 
-Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)	
-Local Binary Patterns (LBP)	
-Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG)	

We use two supervised learning methods to classify our images : 
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
